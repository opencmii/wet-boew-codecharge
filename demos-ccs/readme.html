<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h3>About wet-boew-codecharge</h3>
The goal of the wet-boew-codecharge subproject is to provide ready-to-use clf compliant design templates for CodeChargeStudio Tool.
<h3>About CodeChargeStudio</h3>
<a href="http://www.yessoftware.com/index2.php">CodeChargeStudio</a> is a mature, low cost and polyvalent Rapid Application Development (RAD) tool that facilitates the development and 
re-use of web based data-driven application in the government, supporting many databases (Oracle, DB2, postgresSQL, MySQL, ...) 
and development languages (.NET, C##, php, perl, ...) in a single COTS package.
<p>
<h3>About the demo</h3>
This folder contains a demo application showcasing the first clf Design Template contribution of the wet-boew-codecharge subproject.
The first design template provided is the theme-gcwu-intranet. The Design Template can be selected dynamically at runtime, thus permit 
the theme presented to selected based on network source (intranet or internet) or department source (DND, RCMP, CSA, TB,...).

<p>Although applications created with CodeChargeStudio can be generated for several different OS, database, and programming languages, 
the demo provided herein has been generated for use with only one possible environment configuration: Linux Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP). 
Generation of the demo in any other combination requires a license of CodeChargeStudio application and may require some additional work.
<p>
See each demo change.log for their features and bug fixes.

<h3>Directory Structure</h3>
<ul>Directory demos-ccs contains the run-time version of each demos, generated directly from CCS. Ready-to-run as is on a lamp server.</ul>
<ul>Directory dist-ccs contains the source code version of each demos, and a separate copy of the Design template.</ul>
<p>
<h3>Demo Naming convention</h3>
Due to the versatile build capability of CodeChargeStudio, each demo is identified accoridng to its intended environment configuration at build:<br>
<code>
name-os-dbms-lang: Where name=Application name, os=operating system,dbms=database used and lang=server-side language selected for build.
<br>
Example:<br>
<quote>basic-linux-mysql-php</quote> 		: Basic application demo generated for Linux OS, using MySQL dbms, and server-side language php.
