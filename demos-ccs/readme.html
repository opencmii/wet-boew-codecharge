<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>


This folder contains demo applications generated with CodeChargeStudio, distributed under MIT or GPL2 license.
There are meant to showcase the new clf Design Template contribution of this wet-boew subproject.
The new Design component facilitates the generation of clf compliant web applications by encapsulating the common look-and-feel 
in a user language independent template.

Applications created with CodeChargeStudio can be generated for several different OS, database, and programming languages.
However, the demos provided herein have been generated for use with only one environment configuration: Linux Apache MySQL PHP (LAMP). 
Generation of the demo in any other combination requires (as a minimum) a licensed CodeChargeStudio application.

See each demo change.log for their features and bug fixes.

<h2>DETAILS</h2>

Directory demos-ccs contains the run-time version of each demos, generated directly from CCS. Ready-to-run as is on a lamp server.
Directory dist-ccs contains the source code version of each demos, and of the contributed component. CodeChargeStudio required for changes.
